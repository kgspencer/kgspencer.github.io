      <h2>Merry Christmas!</h2>
      <p>
        This is a web-based Cryptoquip game that I've been working on for the past few weeks. It's similar
        to Wordle in that a new cryptoquip will be available every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few behaviors limited by the scope of this website, which include:
        <ul>
          <li>Your game progress will not be saved if you refresh or exit the page.</li>
          <li>The game only accepts input from the on-screen keyboard, not your physical one.</li>
          <li>Though I tried to test the game, there may be errors on my end.
            Let me know if something isn't working the way it's supposed to!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy this game!</p>
      <p><strong>Love,</strong></p>

        This game is meant to mimic the classic Cryoptoquip game. The given phrase is encrypted
        with a letter substitution cipher. The goal is to decode the phrase by figuring out which
        letter each encrypted letter represents.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hovering over a letter will highlight each same letter, so you can see the placements of
          each character. Clicking on a letter will <strong>select</strong> it. It will look like this:
        </p>
        <p class="ex">Q</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          To swap a letter, you can choose a letter from the keyboard. Once a letter from the phrase
          and the keyboard have been selected, the phrase letter will become <strong>locked</strong>.
          You can still swap a locked letter, but it will not appear highlighted anymore
          when you hover over it. Once locked, the letter will look like this:
        </p>
        <p class="ex locked">Q</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          When you think you've solved the phrase, you can <strong>test</strong> your answer using the Check Answer
          button.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>Notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The timer will start once you have swapped your first letter.</li>
            <li>The 'Selected Letter' on screen refers to the <i>phrase</i> letter you have selected. It is
            useful if you're swapping a locked letter.</li>
            <li>You cannot swap a letter that has already been swapped. Try swapping the desired letter with
            a different one first.</li>
            <li>The order in which you select a phrase letter and keyboard letter should not matter. Note that
            if you choose from the keyboard first, the phrase letter will be locked upon clicking it.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't be able to swap any punctuation or spaces, and their appearance shouldn't change.</li>
          </ul>
